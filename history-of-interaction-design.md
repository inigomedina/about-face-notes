# Roots

In the late 1970s and early 1980s a dedicated and visionary set of researchers, engineers, and designers in the San Francisco Bay Area were busy inventing how people would interact with computers in the future. Xerox Parc, SRI and Apple Computer are figures of that age.

In the mid of 1980s, two industrial designers, Bill Moggride and Bill Verplank, who were working on the first laptop computer, the GRiD Compass, coined the term INTERACTION DESIGN. They coined it for what they were doing.

More than 10 years later the term was rediscovered and brought into mainstream use. At first software design was poorly understood usually practiced by programmers. It was people from other fields, specially technical writers, trainers and product support people, along with a rising number of practicioners from nascent field usability, who realized that something needed to change. The amazing growth and popularity of the Web drove that change. The mantra "ease of use" started to have sense. The Web placed user requirements on the radar of the corporate world for good.

Consumers are sending a clear message that what they want is good technology, not new technology for its own sake: technology that has been designed to provide a compelling and effective user experience.

# Interaction Design as discipline

It is broader than design of user interfaces.

In the world of digital technology, form, function, content, and behavior are so inextricably linked that many of the challenges of designing and interactive product go right to the heart of what a digital product is and what is does.

Industrial designers and graphic designers have traditionally been focused on the design of static form, not the design of interactivity, or form that changes and reacts to input over time. So, they are disciplines that have not a language with wich to discuss and develop that dynamic behavior of user interfaces.

User Experience is not interaction design, since it is not restricted to the world of bits: there are similarities and synergies between creating a customer experience at a physical world and creating one with an interactive product, but here are specific methods for the second one.

Designers of all stripes hope to manage and influence the experiences people have. That is common to every designers. That is done by carefully manipulating the variables intrinsic to the medium at hand: graphic designers using an arrangement of type, photos, illustrations, etc. to help create an experience; furniture designers using materials and construction techniques to help create an experience; interior designer using layout, lighting, materials, sound, to help create an experience. And so on.

In digital products we can think we influence people's experiences by designing the mechanisms for interacting with a product.

Well there are many cases where a design project requires careful attention to the orchestration of a number of design disciplines to achieve an appropriate user experience. We feel the term EXPERIENCE DESIGN is mot applicable. Where Form, Content and Behavior count.

# How Interaction Design should fit within an organization

A good product development process must incorporate design as an equal partner with engineering, marketing and business management. A good approach could be this one.

Design team: has responsibility for users' satisfaction with the product. Many organizations do not hold anyone responsible for this. Designers must have the authority to decide how the product will look, feel and behave. They also need access to information: Thet must observe and speak to potential users about their needs, to engineers about technological opportunities and constraints, to marketing about opportunities and requirements,  and to management about the kind of product to which the organization will commit.

Engineering team: has the responsibility for the implementation and fabrication of the product. They require a clear description of the product's form and behabiors. This conversation must come from the design tem. They must also contribute to discussions of technical constraints and opportunities, as well as the feasibility of proposed design solutions.

Marketing team: has responsibility for convincing customers to purchase the product, so they must have authority over all communications with the customer, as well as input into the product definition and design. They must exchange research information with design team.

Management: has responsibility for the profitability of the resulting product, and therefore has the authority to make decisions about what the other groups will work on.

# Principles, patterns, context

Integrating design principles, processes and patterns is the key to designing effective product interactions and interfaces. But there is no such thing as objectively good user interface, since quality depends on context. Applying a set of one-size-fits-all principles makes user interface creation easier, but it doesn't necessarily make the end result better.

There is no avoiding the hard work: understanding the people who will actually interact with your product. Only then it is useful to have at your command a toolbox of principles and patterns to apply in specific situations.

So, deepen your product's users, and translate that understanding into superior product designs.

# Four steps

There are four main steps to designing interactive systems:

      1. researching the domain
      2. understanding the users and the requirements
      3. defining the framework of a solution
      4. filling in the design details

The fifth step might be validation. But this is a part of a discipline known as Usability: testing the effectiveness of a solution with users.

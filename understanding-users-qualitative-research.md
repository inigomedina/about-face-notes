No matter how skillful and creative the designer, if she does not have clear and detailed knowledge of the users she is designing for, the constrains of the problem, and the business or organizational goals that are driving design activities, she will have little chance of success.

Real insight into these topics can't be achieved by digging through the piles of numbers from different quantitative studies. Rather, this kind of deep knowledge can only be achieved by qualitative research techniques.

# Qualitative vs Quantitative Research

Any attemtp to reduce human behavior to statistics is likely to overlook important nuances, which can make an enormous difference to the design of products. Quantitative research can only answer questions about "how much" or "how many". Qualitative research can tell you about what, how, and why in rich-detail that is reflective of the actual complexities of real human situations.

Social scientists have long realized that human behaviors are too complex and subject to too many variables to rely solely on quantitative data to understand them. Designers and usabilitiers borrow techniques from social sciences, developing many qualitative methods for gathering useful data on user behaviors to a more pragmatic end: to help create products that better serve user needs.

## The value of qualitative research

It helps us understand:

   * behaviors, attitudes, and aptitudes of potential product users
   * technical, business, and environmental contexts -the domain- of the product to be designed
   * vocabulary and other social aspects of the domain in question
   * how existing products are used

It helps to projects by:

   * providing credibility and authority, since design decisions can be traced to research results
   * uniting the team with a common understanding of domain issues and user concerns
   * empowering management to make more informed decisions about product design issues

It helps to answer questions like:

   * How does the product fit into the broader context of people's lives?
   * What goals motivate people to use the product, and what basic tasks help people accomplish these goals?
   * What experiences do people find compelling? How do these relate to the product being designed?
   * What problems do people encounter with their current ways of doing things?


Qualitative research tries to understand the user population as human beings, and finds valuable business insights that are not revealed through traditional market research.

## Types of qualitative research

It will present techniques from a pragmatic perspective. The qualitative research activities that have found to be most useful are:

   * stakeholder interviews
   * subject matter expert (SME) interviews
   * user and customer interviews
   * user observation/ethnographic field studies
   * literature review
   * product/prototype and competitive audits

### Stakeholder interviews

Research for any new product design should start by understanding the business and technical context surrounding the product.

Lemma: Design is a conversation with materials. The designer must understand the capabilities and limitations of these "materials" that will be used to construct the product.

Stakeholder: anyone with authority and/or responsibility for the product being designed. Stakeholders are key members of the organization commissioning the design work, and typically include executives, managers, and representative contributors from development, sales, product management, marketing, customer support, design, and usability.

This kind of interviews should occur before any user research begins, because these discussions often inform how user research is conducted. It is usually most effective to interview each stakeholder in isolation, rather than in a larger, cross-departmental group.

Important information gathered on this kind of interviews:

	  * Preliminary product vision.
	  * Budget and schedule.
	  * Technical constraints and opportunities.
	  * Business drivers.
	  * Stakeholders' perceptions of the user.

As a designer, your job is to develop a vision that the entire team believes in. Without taking the time to understand everyone's perspective, it's unlikely that they will feel that proposed solutions reflect their priorities. These people have the responsibility and authority to deliver the product to the real world. So, they have important knowdledge and opinions.

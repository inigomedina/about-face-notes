Real insight into these topics can't be achieved by digging through the piles of numbers from different quantitative studies. Rather, this kind of deep knowledge can only be achieved by qualitative research techniques.

# Qualitative vs Quantitative Research

Any attemtp to reduce human behavior to statistics is likely to overlook important nuances, which can make an enormous difference to the design of products. Quantitative research can only answer questions about "how much" or "how many". Qualitative research can tell you about what, how, and why in rich-detail that is reflective of the actual complexities of real human situations.

Social scientists have long realized that human behaviors are too complex and subject to too many variables to rely solely on quantitative data to understand them. Designers and usabilitiers borrow techniques from social sciences, developing many qualitative methods for gathering useful data on user behaviors to a more pragmatic end: to help create products that better serve user needs.

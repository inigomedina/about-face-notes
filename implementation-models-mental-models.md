# Computer literacy

It refers those people who will succeed in the information economy.

It's nothing more than a euphemism for forcing human beings to stretch their thinking to understand machine logic. Rather than having software-enabled products stretch to meet people's ways of thinking.

A poor understanding of users and the specific ways they approach digital products has exacerbated the compputer-literacy divide.

# Implementation Models

Any machine has a mechanism for accomplising its purpose. It has been called system model. And implementation model too. It describes the details of the way a program is implemented in code.

Good example: a motion picture projector.


# User Mental Models

The example of the motion picture projector allows to understand how a user doesn't need to understand the implementation model. The viewer imagines that the projector merely throws a picture onto the big screen. And that is called the user's mental model, or conceptual model.

Another good example: household electricity.

Any digital product that relies on software has a behavioral face it shows to the world that is created by the programmer or designer. This ability to represent the computer's functioning independent of its true actions is far more pronounced in software than in any other medium. This disconnection between what is implemented and what is offered as explanation gives rise to a third model in the digital world: the designer's represented model, the way the designer chooses to represent a program's functioning to the user.

Good example: an operating system can make a network file server look as though it were a local disk.

Important: the closer the represented model comes to the user's mental model, the easier he will find the program to use and to understand.

We might talk about a grade between implementation and mental models as the extremes.

Implementation model: the model for how the software actually works.

Mental model: the way the users perceive the jobs they need to do and how the program helps them to do it. It is based on their own ideas of how they do their jobs and how computers might work.

Represented model: the way designers choose to represent the working of the program to the user.

One of the most important goals of the designer should be to make the represented model match the mental model of users as closely as possible. It is therefore critical that designers understand in detail the way their target users think about the work they do with the software.

## Keep it simple

We tend to form mental models that are simpler than reality. So, represented models should be simpler than implementation models.

Good examples: spreadsheets, brake pedal.

User interfaces that are consistent with users' mental models are vastly superior to those that are merely reflections of the implementation model.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE: user interfaces should be based on user mental models rather than implementation models.

Example: In Photoshop you can adjust the color balance and brigtness not using numeric fields of color data -implementation model-, but selecting from a set of thumbnail images with different color balance. The user is thinking in terms of how the image looks, not in terms of abstract numbers.

A good represent model provides a cognitive framework that makes it evident to the user how his goals and needs can be met.


# Most software conforms to implementation models

It is much easier to design software that reflects its implementation model. From the developer's perspective, it's perfectly logical to provide a button for every function, a field for every data input, a page for every transaction, etc.

## User inferfaces designed by engineers follow the implementation model

Good example: home theater system, which requires the user to know exactly how all of the components are wired together.

Good example: drag a file between directories is different than between hard drives, since the first one is a move on the implementation model, and the second one a copy. So, the user must understand that the behavior depends on the physical nature of the particular storage devices.

## Mathematical thinking leads to implementation model interfaces

Mathematical thinking is an implementation model trap that is particularly easy for programmers to fall into.

DESIGN PRINCIPLE: users don't understand boolean logic.

Example: AND OR operators are understood by english language as the exact opposite of the boolean.


# Mechanical-Age versus Information-Age represented models

## Mechanical-Age representations

## New technology demands new representations

The real adavantages of the software products that we create often remain invisible until they have a sizable population of users.

Good examples: email from mechanical-age view is just simpler and faster than postal mail. But it promotes the flattening and democratization of the modern business organization, that is its real advantage.

Good examples: web from mechanical-age view is just cheaper and more efficiente than previous communication and distribution channels. But it creates virtual communities, and that is its real advantage.

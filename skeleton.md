# Main organization

"About Face" is organized into 3 main parts:

       1. Understanding Goal-Directed Design
       2. Designing Behavior and Form
       3. Designing Interaction Details

# Context

The authors put the book in a postindustrial context. That basically means for them that manufacturing is not anymore the primary economic driver. It has lost its leadership to digital technology, where software is now the primary economic driver.

It is not a one-step change but progressive: more and more products have software in them. More and more businesses of all types use software in every facet of their operations, management, planning, and sales. Even communications between vendors, customers, colleages, employees, etc. are via software or software-mediated paths.

The people who make software are different as well. The average computer programmer and the average assembly line worker are qualitatively different in every aspect: aptitude, attitude, training, language, tools, values. Getting programmers to do what is best for the company requires skills unknown to the industrial-age executive.

Industrialization main goal was reducing the cost of manufacturing. In post-industrial age the only leverage to lower manufacturing costs comes through automation, planning and business intelligence. And all that means software.

Reducing the amount one spends on software construction usually means compromising the quality, so the primary business equation of the industrial age is reversed today.

So, since it is a new age, it is no wonder that companies struggle with software. Interaction design is proposed as the best tool for replacing obsolete industrial-age management methods. Interaction design give the right answers for designing and managing software construction.

Interaction design has the capacity of communicating well with the different areas that participate into software construction: managers, marketers, programmers, etc.

Key secret of interaction design is that its point of departure is human-centered, rather than technology-centered. So, first you have to know the business and the people, and only from that you can start to build something. Interaction design is a tool for "Knowing what the user wants". From that point you can create better, more successfull products, and you can sell them for more money.

Interaction design can avoid the feature-loaded products that go early to market. Interaction design put the focus on user research and detailed planning, because in the postindustrial age they are more necessary than ever.

# Premise

If we design and construct products in such a way that the people who use them achieve their goals, these people will be satisfied, effective, and happy and will gladly pay for the products and recommend that others do the same. Assuming that this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner.

Such a premise is so obvious and straightforward that some questions may arise: why then are so many digital products so difficult and unpleasant to use? Why aren't we all happy and successful?

# The problem: methods

Most digital products today emerge from the development process like a creature emerging from a bubbling tank.

Developers, instead of planning and executing with a mind towards satisfying the needs of the people who purchase and use their products, end up creating technologically focused solutions that are difficult to use and control. Like mad scientist, they fail because they have not imbued their creations with humanity.

The proposal of IxD is based on two types of understandings:

    1. understanding users' desires, needs, motivations, and contexts
    2. understanding business, technical, and domain opportunities, requirements, and constraints

From there, using this knowledge as a foundation, we start with plans to create products whose form, content, and behavior is useful, usable, and desirable, as well as economically viable and technically feasible.

So, that foundation is the first step, and the engine that moves everything.

# Digital products today

Digital products come into this world subject to the push and pull of two, often opposing, forces: developers and marketers.

Marketers input into the product design process is often limited to lists of requirements: a list of hundred of features doesn't lend itself to the kind of graceful orchestration that is required to make complex technology useful.

Developers often haveno shortage of input into the product's final form and behavior. They are forced to make significant decisions about the user experience with little time or background.

So, the people who are most often responsible for the creation of our digital products rarely take into account the users' goals, needs, or motivations, and the same time tend to be highly reactive to market trends and technical constraints. The result is often a lack of coherent user experience.

Typical results of poor product vision are: products that irritate, reduce productivity, and fail to meet user needs:

	- Digital products are rude
	- Digital products require people to think like computers
	- Digital products exhibit poor behavior
	- Digital products require humans to do the heavy lifting


# Reasons to explain those "bad products"

There are 3 primary reasons:

      1. Ignorance about users
      2. A conflict of interest between serving human needs and contruction priorities
      3. Lack of a process of understanding human needs


## Ignorance about users

Digital industry doesn't have a good understanding of what it takes to make users happy. In fact, most technology products get built without much understanding of the users.

## Conflicting interests

The people who build the products -programmers- are usually also the people who design them. We should make sure that the people designing a product are not the same people building it.

## The lack of a process

It has no realiable process for making successful products. Engineering, marketing departments have well-established methods. It's left out a repeatable, predictable, and analytical process for transforming an understanding of users into proucts that both meet their needs and excite their imaginations.

Most software has never undergone a rigorous design process from a user-centered perspective.

In most organizations, the digital product interaction design process alternates between the accidental (result of developers' work) and the nonexistent.

The history of deging in manufacturing offers good points to understand the challenges IxD faces.


# Evolution of Design in Manufacturing

Evolution is from engineering + marketing as team, for producing effective products, to teams where design is introduced to increase user desire for a product. So that they can differentiate their products from functionally identical producst made by competitors. There, graphic designers were employed to create more effective packaging and advertising, and industrial designers were engaged to create more comfortable, useful and exciting forms.

Now enter the computer. It introduces interaction, interactivity. It introduces the importance of behavior, and design of behavior is a different kind of problem that requires greater knowledge of CONTEXT, not just rules of visual composition and brand. Design of behavior requires an understanding of the user's relationship with product from before purchage to end-of-life. Most importat of all is the understanding of how the user wishes to use the product.


# Planning and designing behavior

We need to find a systematic approach: a repeatable process of analysis and synthesis.


# User Goals

Goals are not tasks.

Goal is an expectation of an end condition. Tasks are intermediate steps.

There are trends more focused on tasks, and trends more focused on goals. Both highlighting the importance of user's context.

Task orientation is good to understand the WHAT, breaking down its parts.

Goal orientation wants to understand the WHY. They reveal expectations and aspirations. They give the meaning of the tasks.

Goals are more consitent over time, since they are driven by human motivations. That remain the same. Tasks are much more transient.

# Designing to meet goals in context

You can't create good design by following rules disconnected from goals and needs of the users of your product.

A general guideline is: GOOD DESIGN MAKES USERS MORE EFFECTIVE.


# The Goal-Directed Design Process

Most technology-focused companies don't have an adequate process for user-centered design, if they have a process at all.

Research doesn't have a key role. When it has, it is still very difficult to translate research results into design solutiosn or product requirements. We need to bridge that gap.

## Bridgin the gap

First, the role of design in the development process needs to change. We need to start thinking about design in new ways.

Design as product definition. Identifying user requirements, defining a detailed plan for the behavior and appearance of products.

Designers as researchers. One of the most powerful tools designers bring to the table is empathy: the ability to feel what others are feeling. The direct and extensive exposure to users that proper research entails immerse designers in the users' world, and gets them thinking about users long before they propose solutions.

One of the most dangerous practices in product development is isolating designers from the users because doing so eliminates empathic knowledge.

# Process overview

It can be divided into 6 phases:

   1. research				Understanding
   2. modeling				Abstracting
   3. requirements definition		Structuring
   4. framework definition		Representing
   5. refinement			Detailing
   6. support
